\begin{abstract}
In this paper we propose to use Bayesian optimization (BO) to improve the efficiency of the selection process of designs in clinical trials.
BO is a method to optimize expensive black-box functions that uses a regression as a surrogate to guide the search.
In clinical trials, planning test procedures and sample sizes is a crucial task.
A common goal is to maximize the test power, given a set of treatment and effect sizes under the null hypothesis.
From a wide range of possible alternatives we want to select the best plan in a short period of time, to enable quick decisions.
The standard approach to simulate the power for each single setup can become too time-consuming, when the number of possible setups becomes very large.
Then, either large computational resources are required or an exhaustive exploration of all possible setups takes a very long time.
In this work we propose to use BO to quickly find a clinical trial setup with high power from a large number of setups options.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by optimizing the power of adaptive seamless designs for different sets of treatment effect sizes.
We compare the BO approach with an exhaustive evaluation of all candidate designs.
The optimization approach finds competitive setups in a fraction of the time.

\section{Introduction}

Clinical research and in particular drug development is typically structured into phases, e.g. phases I to IV in drug development. 
Similar approaches exist for complex interventions, such as the MRC framework for non-pharmacological interventions~\citep{campbell_framework_2000}.
The development phases include elements of learning and confirmation.
For instance, \citet{sheiner_learning_1997} describe the drug development process as two learning and confirming cycles:
The first cycle includes learning about the tolerated dose (Phase I) and confirming the efficacy of the selected dose in a selected group of patients (Phase IIa), whereas the second cycle consists of learning about the optimal use in representative patients (Phase IIb) and confirming of an acceptable benefit or risk ratio (Phase III).

Traditionally, separate studies are performed for learning and confirming.
However, the landscape in clinical research is changing.
Boundaries between the development phases are increasingly dissolving in multiple aspects.
Master protocols are a new concept where multiple subgroups and substudies are integrated~\citep{bogin_master_2020}.
Here, simultaneously, more than one treatment and more than one disease type are investigated within the same overall trial structure.
Adaptive designs are established, but are being further developed.
In general, study designs become more flexible, and more principled approaches to decision making using statistical modeling and integrated analyses across studies become popular. 
A related principle on the analysis side is evidence synthesis, which is a way of combining information from several studies that have examined the same question to come to an overall understanding.

The increasing complexity of both the designs and the analyses of clinical trials has the consequence that the planning of such studies often relies also on computer simulations, especially if no closed form solutions for calculations are available.
This applies even to usually fairly straightforward tasks as sample size calculations. 
Various frameworks and guidance proposals have been developed over the past years on how to plan, execute and interpret the results of such simulation studies.
Method comparison studies are used to give clinicians and biostatisticians guidance when an approach improves currently used methods~\citep{hanneman_design_2008}.  
Depending on the setting and the purpose of the simulation study, suitable metrics must be chosen to compare alternative designs or analysis strategies. 
Especially relevant are neutral comparison studies, which are characterized by~\citet{boulesteix_plea_2013} as follows:
%FIXME Is there someting missing? (Jakob)
The primary goal of the respective article is not to introduce a new promising method, the authors are reasonably neutral, and the evaluation metrics, methods, and data sets are chosen in a rational way.
%While method comparison studies aim to make statements when one approach might dominate others in terms of the chosen metrics, in designing an individual study or series of studies the objective is to identify a design that is optimal in terms of the metrics chosen in a certain scenario or, more importantly, across a set of scenarios. 
A comprehensive framework for such an objective assessment of competing strategies for clinical trial designs is CSE (Clinical Scenario Evaluation)~\citep{benda_aspects_2010,friede_refinement_2010}.
CSE was particularly developed to support the overall process of performing simulations of clinical trials, especially for complex designs and analysis strategies.
The problem is decomposed into data models, analysis models, and evaluation models that specify the evaluation metrics.

Here, we propose to use a formal approach to optimization of the clinical trial design, in the situation of a very large number of available options for the parameters specifying the design. 
This set of candidate designs can be regarded as a multi-dimensional search space, including potentially many real-valued and categorical parameters.
The vast space of possible designs makes the optimization computationally demanding.
In the following, we demonstrate that the so-called \emph{Bayesian optimization} (BO) framework~\citep{jones_taxonomy_2001} can be successfully applied to select a clinical trial design.
As evaluation metric we consider the specific case that the statistical power of the clinical trial design should be maximized, for given effect sizes and number of treatments.
Further, it is crucial that such a design is found in a short time.

BO, often also called Model-based optimization, has been successfully applied to optimize expensive black-boxes in many different scenarios.
Popular applications include hyper-parameter tuning of machine learning methods~\citep{snoek_practical_2012}, general algorithm configuration~\citep{hutter_sequential_2011}, and many more.
Various implementations of BO methods are used widely, such as SMAC~\citep{hutter_sequential_2011}, Spearmint~\citep{snoek_practical_2012}, and BoTorch~\citep{balandat_botorch_2020}.
For this work we use the implementation in the R-package \texttt{mlrMBO}~\citep{bischl_mlrmbo_2017}.
This implementation has been successfully used to optimize hyper-parameters of machine learning methods on various tasks~\citep{bischl_mlrmbo_2017, wozniak_candle_2018}, and in the biomedical context it has been applied to optimize model-weights~\citep{richter_modelbased_2019,browaeys_nichenet_2020}.
Also, BO is well suited for multi-criteria optimization.
Different adaptions of BO exist~\citep{horn_modelbased_2015} that return a set of non-dominated points.
Many of them are implemented in \texttt{mlrMBO} as well.
However, in this work we restrict ourselves to single-criteria optimization. 

The remainder of the manuscript is structured as follows.
In the next section we present as motivating example an application of adaptive seamless designs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
In the sections~\ref{sec:adaptive_seamless_designs} and~\ref{sec:bayesian_optimization}, we explain the background on adaptive seamless designs (asd) and Bayesian optimization (BO), respectively.
In section~\ref{sec:simulation_study}, we present a simulation study that is closely related to the motivating example and in which the suitability of BO for optimizing trial designs is demonstrated.
In the last Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss promising extensions as well as limitations of the approach.

\section{Motivating Example}
\label{sec:motivating_example}

The general idea of this paper is to apply BO for finding a trial design that is optimal with respect to a certain metric.
As an example, we consider the maximization of the statistical power of a trail design, given a set of parameters to be chosen for the trial design.
We compare the computation time as well as the maximal obtained power between the results obtained with BO and with an exhaustive grid search over the space of adjustable parameters.
The presented optimization approach can also be applied for optimizing other metrics than the power, as long as the metric itself is numeric and the parameters of the trial design are numeric and include none or just few categorical choices.

One specific trial design that falls into this category are \emph{adaptive seamless designs}~\citep{barnes_integrating_2010} as implemented in the \texttt{asd}~\cite{parsons_software_2011} package and described in Section~\ref{sec:adaptive_seamless_designs}.

For the COPD trial, an interim treatment selection was performed. 
Indacaterol is a drug administered to COPD patients.
The patients were randomized to four doses of indacaterol (\SI{75}{\micro\gram}, \SI{150}{\micro\gram}, \SI{300}{\micro\gram} and \SI{600}{\micro\gram}), active controls, and placebo control.
As in \citet{friede_adaptive_2020}, here we ignore the active controls.
The primary outcome of the trial was the percentage of days of poor control over 26 weeks of the COPD patients.
Since the recruitment took only a short time, another outcome was required for treatment selection, in this case forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at 15 days.
In the original study, the difference in FEV1 compared to placebo at 15 days for the different doses and corresponding confidence intervals were estimated.
From these, standardized effect sizes were estimated as approximately 0.68, 0.82, 0.95, and 0.91 for the four  indacaterol doses \SI{75}{\micro\gram}, \SI{150}{\micro\gram}, \SI{300}{\micro\gram}, and \SI{600}{\micro\gram}, respectively.
For the final outcome days of poor control, also, from real data the standardized effect sizes were estimated.
These were approximately 0.13, 0.17, 0.23, and 0.20, for the four doses.
The approximate sample sizes per arm were 100 patients in stage 1 and 300 patients in stage 2.

In the analysis of \citet{friede_adaptive_2020}, the aim was to select two doses of indacaterol at the interim analysis that are passed to stage 2, resulting in a total sample size $5 \cdot 100 + 3 \cdot 300 = 1,400$ patients. 
In the simulations, a positive correlation between early and final outcomes of 0.4 was assumed.
Further, different settings with continuous early and continuous or binary final outcomes and different treatment selection strategies were compared.

\section{Adaptive Seamless Designs}
\label{sec:adaptive_seamless_designs}

% Is there a condensed version? In Friede et al (2020) it is only explained in detail?
% TODO: Tim
Traditionally drug development is organized in four phases with individual clinical trials for the separate phases. Seamless designs combine elements from different development phases in a single trial thereby offering the promise of speeding up development times. For instance, seamless phase II/III designs combine the learning about dose-response relationship or subgroup heterogeneity typical for phase II with confirmation of treatment effects in phase III. If the data of the phase II part are used for confirmatory purposes, then this needs to be accounted for in the testing strategy to maintain the familywise type I error rate in the strong sense. This type of designs are referred to as adaptive seamless designs. A recent overview can be found in \citet{friede_adaptive_2020}.

We start by providing some more details on the study design considered (Sections \ref{ssec:two_stage_design_with_treatment_selection} and \ref{ssec:selection_rules}) and then introduce briefly a framework for optimizing such designs, namely clinical scenario evaluation (CSE) in Section \ref{ssec:clinical_scenario_evaluation_for_asd}. %In Section \ref{ssec:simulating_asd} we make some brief comments on the simulation model.

\subsection{Two-stage design with treatment selection}
\label{ssec:two_stage_design_with_treatment_selection}
Here we consider a particular type of adaptive seamless designs, namely two-stage designs with treatment (or more specifically dose) selection. The trial starts in stage 1 with $K$ experimental treatments or doses of one experimental treatment which are compared to a common control. Interest is in assessing the treatment effects $\beta_k$ with $k=1,\dots, K$ comparing experimental treatment $k$ vs. control and testing the null hypotheses $H_{0,k}: \beta_k=0$ against the alternative  $H_{1,k}: \beta_k>0$ (larger $\beta_k$ being better). For the purpose of treatments selection, test statistics $Z_{1,k}$ based on data from the first design stage are considered with larger $Z_{1,k}$ indicating more beneficial treatments. These can use data on the primary outcome used for testing or any other outcome that is available at the time of the interim analysis. In practical applications, early outcomes are often used to inform interim decisions, since the primary endpoint might take a longer time to observe. In the interim analysis, treatments are selected for continuation into the second stage; the set of selected treatments is denoted by $\mathcal{S}$. The selection rules used here are described in Section \ref{ssec:selection_rules}. In the final analysis, the closed test principle is applied to account for the multiple hypotheses. The intersection hypotheses are tested by combining stagewise $p$-values for the respective intersection hypotheses using a prespecified combination function. Here we use the inverse normal combination function~\citep{lehmacher_adaptive_1999} which is given by
\begin{equation}
   w_1 \Phi^{-1}(1-p_{\mathcal{K},1}) + w_2 \Phi^{-1}(1-p_{\mathcal{K},2}) \,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi^{-1}(\cdot)$ denotes the quantile function of the standard normal distribution, $w_1$ and $w_2$ weights with $w_1^2+w_2^2 = 1$, and $p_{\mathcal{K},1}$ and $p_{\mathcal{K},2}$ stagewise $p$-values testing intersection hypothesis $H_{\mathcal{K}}$. The p-values for stages $1$ and $2$ are calculated on those patient recruited in stages $1$ and $2$, respectively. Note that one might not be able to calculate $p_{\mathcal{K},1}$ at the time of the interim analysis since some patients might still be under follow-up for the final endpoint.

\subsection{Selection rules}
\label{ssec:selection_rules}
In practice, the totality of the data would be considered by a data monitoring committee (DMC) to make a recommendation regarding the treatment selection. However, it is advisable for the sponsor to define a selection rule, although in comparison fairly simplistic, to provide some guidance for the DMC regarding the sponsor's preferences. Furthermore, formal selection rules are indispensable to conduct simulation studies, e.g. to explore sample size and power. In the following we give some examples of selection rules which have previously been consider and which will feature below.

The treatment selection might consider statistics $Z_{1,k}$ for the final (primary) outcome or statistics $Z_{1,k}^{(E)}$ calculated based on some early outcome. We present the selection rules using $Z_{1,k}^{(E)}$, but of course these would be replaced by $Z_{1,k}$ if the final outcome was used for treatment selection. Furthermore, larger statistics are considered better. 

\paragraph{$\kappa$-best Rule} Let $Z_{1,(1)}^{(E)}, \dots, Z_{1,(K)}^{(E)}$ denote the ordered statistics with $Z_{1,(1)}^{(E)}$ being the largest and therefore best test statistic. The $\kappa$-best rule then selects the treatments associated with the $\kappa$ largest $Z_{1,k}^{(E)}$, i.e.$Z_{1,(1)}^{(E)}, \dots, Z_{1,(\kappa)}^{(E)}$.

\paragraph{Epsilon Rule} To our knowledge this rule was first described by \citet{kelly_adaptive_2005} and has since then featured in a number of simulation studies including \citet{friede_comparison_2008, friede_adaptive_2020}. All treatments $k$ with $Z_{1,k}^{(E)} \ge \max_i Z_{1,i}^{(E)} - \epsilon$ with $\epsilon \ge 0$ are selected. With $\epsilon=0$ this rule is equivalent to the $\kappa$-best rule with $\kappa=1$. 

\paragraph{Threshold Rule} With this rule all treatments $k$ are selected with $Z_{1,k}^{(E)} \ge \tau$ where $\tau$ is a given threshold.

We note that with the $\kappa$-best rule a fixed number of treatments is carried forward into the next stage whereas these are variable with the epsilon rule and the threshold rule.


\subsection{Clinical scenario evaluation for ASD}
\label{ssec:clinical_scenario_evaluation_for_asd}

The clinical scenario evaluation framework was first proposed by \citet{benda_aspects_2010} and subsequently developed further by \citet{friede_refinement_2010}. 
Figure \ref{fig:friede_refinement_2010_fig2} provides a summary of this framework.

\end{figure}
A clinical scenario evaluation is defined by the following three elements: (i) disease-specific features; (ii) design options; and (iii) design performance measures. The design specific features describe distributional assumptions on the early and final outcomes including variances, correlations and treatment effect sizes. Here, those that can be estimated from data of previous clinical trials and those that are simply unknown. Considering adaptive seamless design, the design options include the time point of the interim analysis and the treatment selection rule, which can in principle both be chosen without any restrictions. In contrast, some other design options such as the number of treatments and the total sample size are constrained by the environment and infrastructure available. The performance measures (sometimes also referred to as metrics) are in the context with adaptive seamless designs e.g. power or sample size distributions.
%\paragraph{Simulating ASD}
%\label{ssec:simulating_asd}
The evaluation of some performance measures requires Monte Carlo simulations, since no closed form solutions are available. 
The R-package \texttt{asd} by~\citet{parsons_software_2011} can be used for such simulations.
As it generates test statistics it is generally more efficient in comparison to simulating individual participant data.
The simulation model was described in more detail by \citet{friede_adaptive_2020}. 
It features selection at interim based on early as well as final outcomes.

Bayesian optimization (BO)~\citep{jones_taxonomy_2001}, also known as Model-based Optimization (MBO), is a state-of-the-art~\citep{shahriari_taking_2016} technique for expensive black-box optimization problems.
In comparison to other black-box optimization methods, like Genetic Algorithms or Simulated Annealing, BO is especially suitable when evaluating a configuration (e.g.\ running a simulation with certain parameters, here denoted by $\theta$) is very time consuming.
As then it becomes infeasible to evaluate the black-box for thousands of configurations.

\subsection{General principle}
BO solves an optimization problem within a bounded search space $\Theta$:
\[
\theta^\ast := \operatorname{arg\,max}_{\theta \in \Theta} f(\theta),
\]
where $f(\theta)$ denotes the evaluation of the black-box with the input configuration $\theta$.
To reduce the number of evaluations on $f$ the key idea of BO is to only evaluate values of $\theta$ that are estimated to lead to a high value of $f(\theta)$.
The estimate is generated by a so called \emph{surrogate model}.
Typically, this is a regression model that predicts the outcome of $f$ based on previous evaluations of $f$.
First, an initial design of already evaluated configurations is needed.
Then, iteratively, the BO algorithm fits the surrogate on the previous evaluations, proposes a new configuration $\theta$ and evaluates it on $f$.
The steps are repeated until a budget is exhausted.

The proposal of a new configuration $\theta$ is obtained by maximizing a so called acquisition function.
The acquisition function guides the search to promising new regions in the search space $\Theta$ by using the mean prediction $\hat{\mu}(\theta)$ as well as the uncertainty quantification $s^2(\theta)$ of the surrogate.
It balances between exploration of not yet evaluated regions in $\Theta$ and exploitation.
The acquisition function achieves exploration by assigning high values to areas where the surrogate predicts a high uncertainty.
Exploitation is achieved by assigning high values to areas of $\theta$ where the surrogate predicts a high outcome of $f$.
For deterministic functions the expected improvement~\citep{jones_efficient_1998} is arguably the most popular acquisition function.

\subsection{Acquisition function for noisy outcomes}
Since this work focuses on optimization of a stochastic simulation, we assume that our non-deterministic optimization problem can be formulated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\theta^\ast := \operatorname{arg\,max}_{\theta \in \Theta} f(\theta) + \varepsilon, \, \text{ with } \, \varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) %\text{ i.i.d.}
\end{equation}
In this setting, the expected improvement is not feasible, as shown in \citet{huang_global_2006}.
They propose to use the augmented expected improvement instead.
Therefore, in a first step, we calculate the \emph{effective best solution}:
\begin{equation}
  \theta^{\ast\ast} := \operatorname{arg\,max}\limits_{\theta \in \mathcal{D}} \hat{\mu}(\theta) - c \cdot s(\theta),
\end{equation}
with $c$ as a tuning parameter that is usually set to 1 and $\mathcal{D}$ as the design that contains all previously evaluated values of $\theta$.
The effective best point is the pessimistic estimate of the best observed outcome so far.
In the final step, we calculate the augmented expected improvement~\citep{huang_global_2006} as follows:
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:aei}
  \operatorname{AEI}(\theta) = \left( \hat{\mu}(\theta) - \hat{\mu}(\theta^{\ast\ast}) \right) \cdot  \Phi \biggl( \frac{\hat{\mu}(\theta) - \hat{\mu}(\theta^{\ast\ast})}{s(\theta)} \biggr) \\
   + s(\theta) \cdot \phi \biggl( \frac{\hat{\mu}(\theta) - \hat{\mu}(\theta^{\ast\ast})}{s(\theta)} \biggr) \cdot \biggl(1 - \underbrace{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + s^2(\theta)}}}_{\text{correction}}\biggr),
\end{multline}
where $\Phi$ and $\phi$ are the distribution and density function of the standard normal distribution, and $\sigma^2$ denotes the random error (nugget effect) in the Kriging model.
The formula is derived under the assumption, that at each point $\theta \in \Theta$ the posterior of the function outcome follows a normal distribution.
This assumption is also reflected by using a Gaussian process regression as a surrogate.
The intuition in formula (\ref{eq:aei}) is that the first summand favors exploitation while the second summand favors exploration.
The correction term is necessary to avoid exploration in areas where the model uncertainty $s^2(\theta)$ equals the random error $\sigma^2$, because in this case further evaluations will not decrease the model uncertainty.

\subsection{Selection of the best point from noisy outcomes}
\label{ssec:best_point}
If we chose the configuration $\theta$ from all previously evaluated configurations according to the best outcome of $f$ as the optimization result, we would be overly optimistic.
It is likely that a single best outcome can be partially attributed to the random error $\sigma^2$.
Instead, we are interested in the optimum of the true posterior mean.
Therefore, we employ the surrogate estimate of the posterior mean for each evaluated configuration to cancel out the noise.
The configuration for which the surrogate estimates the best outcome is then returned as the optimization result $\hat{\theta}^\ast$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\theta}^{\ast} := \operatorname{arg\,max}\limits_{\theta \in \mathcal{D}} \hat{\mu}(\theta),
\end{equation}
%To obtain a final outcome $\nu^\ast = f(\theta^\ast)$ that is independent of the optimization process, $f(\theta^\ast)$ is calculated again.
Using the stochastic outcome $f(\hat{\theta}^\ast) $ observed during the optimization process would still potentially lead to an overly optimistic result.
Therefore an independent calculation of $f(\hat{\theta}^\ast)$ should be conducted to obtain a fair estimate of the true value of the best outcome.

\section{Simulation Study}
\label{sec:simulation_study}

The goal of this simulation study is to investigate the potential benefit of BO for effectively finding a clinical trial design that maximizes a metric.
The analysis is motivated by the clinical example with COPD patients introduced in Section~\ref{sec:motivating_example}, with treatment selection in the first of two stages.
In the first stage five arms (defined by the control and four different administered doses) are considered, and in the second stage only a selected subset of arms is kept for further evaluation. 
The metric to be optimized is the statistical power, where a positive outcome means a trial arm with true effect is detected as significant effect.

\subsection{Clinical trial design and parameters}
\label{subsec:design}
For the true effect sizes in the simulation, we consider four \emph{effect sets} whose values are inspired and partially based on the corresponding numbers of the motivating example, see Table~\ref{tab:table_effect_names}.
\input{generated/tables/table_effect_names.tex}
For the effect set \emph{paper} we use exactly the same numbers as in~\citet{friede_adaptive_2020}.
For the effect set \emph{paper2} the effect sizes for the second stage are doubled.
As further case we consider a \emph{linear} effect set with effect sizes linear increasing from 20\% to 80\% for the first stage and effect sizes divided by 4 for the second stage as well as a \emph{sigmoid} relationship, again with 4 times larger effect sizes for the first stage.
These sets reflect different realistic situations.

The strategies for treatment selection for the second stage in the two-phase trial design and their corresponding parameters that are used in the simulation study are given in Table~\ref{tab:selection_strategies} and Table~\ref{tab:search_space}, respectively.
The strategies follow the concept of adaptive seamless designs discussed in Section~\ref{sec:adaptive_seamless_designs}. 
The strategies 1, 2, 3, and \emph{all} select the $k$ best strategies according to their respective test statistics in the first stage (with \emph{all} representing all $k=4$ treatments besides the control). 
The strategies \emph{eps} and \emph{thresh} represent strategies with a flexible number of treatments taken to the second stage. 
In Table~\ref{tab:search_space} the ranges for these two parameters and for the proportion of patients (ratio $r$) allocated to the second stage are given.

  $\epsilon$ (only for \emph{eps}) & $[0,4]$ \\
  $\tau$ (only for \emph{thresh})  & $[0,10]$ \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Calculation of the statistical power}

The simulation of the statistical power of the trail design can be formulated as a black-box function as follows:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:bbox}
  y & = f(n_{\text{stage1}}, n_{\text{stage2}}, \text{selection strategy}, \epsilon, \tau, \text{effect set}) \ ,
\end{align}
whereas $n_{\text{stage1}}$ and $n_{\text{stage2}}$ be the numbers of patients allocated to each treatment in stage 1 and stage 2 of the trial, respectively and \emph{effect set} remains fixed as we are interested in the optimal trail design for a given \emph{effect set}.
Our main optimization goal is to maximize the statistical power $y$ depending on the trial design. 

However, we are interested in keeping the total number of treatments $n_{\text{treat}}$ constant in the overall trail for a fair comparison of the power of different designs.
Therefore we introduce the ratio of patients per treatment in stage 1, compared to patients per treatment in both stages
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:r}
 r & = \frac{n_{\text{stage1}}}{n_{\text{stage1}}+n_{\text{stage2}}}
\end{align}
as a new parameter that will replace $n_{\text{stage1}}$ and $n_{\text{stage2}}$ in~(\ref{eq:bbox}). 

In the following we will explain how we derive the values of $n_{\text{stage1}}$ and $n_{\text{stage2}}$ in dependence of $r$ and $n_{\text{treat}}$ so that we can maximize
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bbox2}
  y = \tilde{f}(r, \text{selection strategy}, \epsilon, \tau, \text{effect set}, n_{\text{treat}})
\end{equation}
instead of~(\ref{eq:bbox}), whereas $n_{\text{treat}}$ and \emph{effect set} remain fixed.

Let $k_1$ and $k_2$ denote the number of treatments in stage 1 and stage 2, respectively. 
Within one stage, the same number of patients are allocated to all different treatments. 
Then $n_{\text{treat}}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ntreat}
  n_{\text{treat}} = k_1 \cdot n_{\text{stage1}} + k_2 \cdot n_{\text{stage2}} \ .
\end{equation}
In our scenario (as described in Section \ref{subsec:design}) we have $k_1 = 5$ and $k_2 \in \{2, \ldots, 5\}$, where $k_2$ depends on the result of the treatment selection strategy in stage 1.
The control treatment is included in both stages.

Given the number of treatments $k_1$ and $k_2$ in the two stages and the total number of patients $n_{\text{treat}}$, optimizing the power with respect to $n_{\text{stage1}}$ and $n_{\text{stage2}}$ is equivalent to optimizing with respect to $r$, since
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stagec}
  %\begin{split}
  n_{\text{stage1}} & = 
  n_{\text{stage1}}\cdot \frac{n_{\text{treat}}}{k_1\cdot n_{\text{stage1}}+k_2\cdot n_{\text{stage2}}} = 
  n_{\text{treat}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{stage1}}}{k_1\cdot n_{\text{stage1}}+k_2\cdot n_{\text{stage2}}} \nonumber \\
  & = n_{\text{treat}}\cdot
  \frac{r}{k_1\cdot
  r+k_2\cdot (1-r)} \ \text{and} \nonumber \\
  n_{\text{stage2}} & =
  n_{\text{treat}}\cdot
  \frac{1-r}{k_1\cdot
  r+k_2\cdot (1-r)}.
  %\end{split}
\end{align}
%For $k_1 = k_2 = 5$, $c$ would be $n_{\text{treat}} \cdot \frac{1}{5}$ because for each arm we can distribute $\frac{1}{5}$ of the treatments across stage 1 and stage 2.
These formulas give the numbers of patients per treatment arm in the two stages, if $k_2$ is known. 
This is only the case for selection strategies 1, 2, and 3.

For the selection strategies \emph{eps} and \emph{thresh}, $k_2$ depends on the outcome of stage 1.
%choice of the \emph{thresh} or \emph{eps} parameter.
In these cases, for given values of $n_{\text{stage1}}$ and $\epsilon$ or $\tau$, respectively, we can obtain an estimate $\hat{k}_2$ of $k_2$ with a so-called calibration step.
For a set of values for $n_{\text{stage1}}$ in the interval $\left[ \lceil 0.01 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{treat}}}{k_1} \rceil, \lceil \frac{n_{\text{treat}}}{k_1} \rceil \right]$, we simulate stage 1 of the trial multiple times.
We calculate $n_{\text{stage2}} = (1-r)/r\cdot n_{\text{stage1}}$ from formula (\ref{eq:r}) and $\hat{k}_2$ as the average of the resulting values of $k_2$ for all simulations with a fixed value for $n_{\text{stage1}}$.
Then we select the value of $n_{\text{stage1}}$ such that the corresponding number of total patients is closest to $n_{\text{treat}}$.
More precisely, we minimize
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:targettreat}
  \begin{split}
  h(n_{\text{stage1}}) &:= \left( \Big(k_1 \cdot n_{\text{stage1}} + \hat{k}_2 \cdot %\underbrace{
  \frac{1-r}{r} \cdot n_{\text{stage1}}
  %}_{=n_{\text{stage2}}}
  \Big) - n_{\text{treat}} \right)^2
%  \hat{k}_2 &= f(n_{\text{stage1}}, 1, \text{effect set}, \text{Selection strategy}, \text{Epsilon}, \text{Threshold})_{k_2}
  \end{split}
\end{align}
with respect to $n_{\text{stage1}}$, where the estimate $\hat{k}_2$ is obtained as described above dependent on $n_{\text{stage1}}$. 
%$f$ is the simulator black-box from Equation~\ref{eq:bbox}, that gives us the estimated number of $\hat{k}_2$.
%This number is independent of the simulation of the second stage, so we can set $n_{\text{stage2}}$ to 1.
%The value of $\hat{k}_2$ that was observed with the minimal outcome of $h$ is then used to calculate $c$ in equation~\ref{eq:ntreatcc}.
The calibration step is necessary to guarantee that the total number of treatments $n_{\text{treat}}$ is (in average) the same, also for the variable selection strategies \emph{eps} and \emph{thresh}.

The above procedure gives us the values for $n_{\text{stage1}}$ and $n_{\text{stage2}}$, allowing us in the following to find the optimal clinical trial design for a given \emph{effect set} and number of total treatments, by optimizing the parameter values for $r$, \emph{Selection strategy}, $\epsilon$ and $\tau$ through maximizing $\tilde f$ in~\ref{eq:bbox2}.

\subsection{Optimization strategies}

In the simulation study we compare the ability of two optimization approaches for finding an optimal parameter configuration, on the one hand an exhaustive grid search on the parameter space and on the other hand BO (Bayesian optimization).
For different scenarios we compare the statistical power of the best found clinical trial design.
We also compare the runtime needed to determine the respective optimization results.
Next we introduce the two optimization strategies.

\paragraph{Grid and Grid small}
We conduct an \emph{exhaustive grid search} with a resolution of $k$ points per real-valued dimension and one point for each categorical dimension.
Referring to our application, for each selection strategy we evaluate a numerical grid with a resolution of $k$.
All 6 selection strategies have the numeric parameter $r$.
The strategies \emph{epsilon} and \emph{thresh} both have an additional second parameter, $\epsilon$ or $\tau$, respectively.
Using $k=25$, we call this approach \textbf{Grid},
with in a total $4 \cdot 25 + 2 \cdot 25 \cdot 25 = 1350$ design configurations that are evaluated for one scenario.
Using a subset of this grid with $k=7$ points per dimension, resulting in $4 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 7 = 126$ design configurations, we call the method \textbf{Grid Small}.
Both grids are evaluated with 20 stochastic replications to estimate the variance of the estimated power.

The best point per evaluated grid is determined by selecting the configuration with the best outcome, i.e.\  the concrete trail design with the largest power.
The corresponding value is generally too optimistic, as the random noise on the estimated value can contribute to the quality of the outcome.
To account for this optimism and report unbiased performance estimates, for each of the 20 replicate simulations, we identify the best configuration and consider the corresponding 19 outcomes of the other 19 replicate simulations, similar to a cross-validation framework in machine learning applications. 
%This eliminates the risk of only reporting outcomes that are optimal by chance.

\paragraph{BO (Model-based optimization) and BO Grid}
For applying BO, we first define how the surrogate model that predicts the outcome of $f$ for unknown values of $\theta$ (parameter configurations) is generated.
As regression model for the surrogate we choose Kriging (also called Gaussian process regression) and use the implementation in the R-package \texttt{DiceKriging}~\citep{roustant_dicekriging_2012}, because it is known to work well for fairly low dimensional search spaces.
We configure Kriging to apply the Mattern$\frac{5}{2}$ kernel with an estimated \emph{nugget effect} to account for the noisy response of $f$ and without scaling the input variables to $[0,1]$.

Kriging expects a numerical input, but our search space contains categorical parameters and is even hierarchical.
First, to transform the categorical parameters of the search space (see Table~\ref{tab:search_space}) into numerical values we use one-hot encoding.
Furthermore, our search space is hierarchical because the parameters $\epsilon$ and $\tau$ are only active for the respective selection strategies \emph{eps} and \emph{thresh}.
The hierarchical structure introduces inactive values for the configurations ($\theta$), i.e.\ if \emph{selection strategy} is set to \emph{eps} then the parameter $\tau$ of \emph{thresh} is inactive.
If a value is inactive, we set it to a value two times as high as the maximum in its active range (e.g.\ if $\tau$ is inactive it will be set to 20).
This ensures that within the original range the Kriging model is not or only minimally affected by the inactive values.
Note, that this trick only works because we did not scale the input variables to $[0,1]$ and because the estimated covariance of the Mattern$\frac{5}{2}$ kernel is approximately zero for distances greater than $4$.
With the above steps we ensure that the input for the Kriging is purely numeric.

As an acquisition function we choose the $\operatorname{AEI}$ as explained in Section~\ref{sec:bayesian_optimization}.
We start BO with an initial design of $16$ randomly sampled points and allow $100$ further iterations, summing up to a total budget of $116$ evaluated configurations of the simulator $\tilde{f}$.

At the end of the optimization procedure, the best configuration is chosen according to the best prediction obtained on the set of evaluated points as explained in Section~\ref{ssec:best_point}.
Again, overoptimism must be avoided. 
Thus, the best selected parameter configuration is then independently evaluated $20$ times again.

The whole BO procedure is repeated $20$ times to estimate the variance of the optimal solution found.

Additionally we investigate how \emph{BO} performs when it is limited to return configurations that are within the grid introduced previously.
Therefore we introduce \textbf{BO Grid}, which executes the optimization exactly as \emph{BO}, but the best configuration is mapped to the closest value on the grid. 
In other words, for \emph{BO Grid} we conduct the independent evaluation using the configuration within the grid that is closest to the optimal configuration that is proposed by \emph{BO}.
The comparison of the results of \emph{BO Gird} and \emph{Gird} will allow two possible conclusions:
First, if \emph{BO Grid} is worse then \emph{BO}, we can assume that the resolution of \emph{Grid} is not high enough to find an optimal configuration.
Second, if \emph{BO Grid} is better then \emph{Grid}, it shows that \emph{Grid} did not select the optimal configuration, due to noise.
Summing up, there are two factors that can prevent \emph{Grid} from finding the optimal configuration: lack of resolution and noise of the outcome.

\subsection{Implementation}

The algorithms used in this study are implemented in R.
For the Bayesian optimization, the R-package \texttt{mlrMBO}~\citep{bischl_mlrmbo_2017} is used.
For the simulation of clinical trials, the function \texttt{treatsel.sim} of the R-package \texttt{asd}~\citep{parsons_software_2011} is used, with parameter values given in Table~\ref{tab:par_implement}.
The vector of treatment numbers for determining power \texttt{ptest} counts rejections of 3 or 4 hypotheses ???.
Note that the parameter \texttt{nsim} denotes the internal simulation iterations of $f$. 
The ten additional stochastic repetitions we conduct for the \emph{grid search} and \emph{BO} are additional replicates.

\subsection{Main results for comparison of algorithms}

In this chapter we present an overview of the results for the comparison of the four optimization strategies: exhaustive \emph{Grid} search, grid search with a reduced resolution (\emph{Grid Small}), \emph{BO} and \emph{BO Grid}.
We focus our comparison on independent, replicated evaluations of the configurations proposed by each optimizer.
The evaluations provide unbiased estimates of the performance ($y_{\text{valid}}$) of all optimizers.

For this study we consider 12 scenarios.
The scenarios are generated by combining the four different effect sets (see Table~\ref{tab:table_effect_names}) with the three different numbers for $n_{\text{treat}}$.
Each optimizer is applied on each scenario with 20 stochastic repetitions.

Figure~\ref{fig:plot_boxplot_valid_y} shows the estimated power values $y_{\text{valid}}$ for the best solutions in each scenario.
The plots show that \emph{BO} generally gives results that are comparable to those obtained with the (exhaustive) \emph{Grid} method across all scenarios. 
Only in some cases \emph{Grid} has a slight advantage (\emph{effect: linear}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 2000$; \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$; \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 2000$).
Below we will see that these scenarios have in common that the optimal configuration is close to the border of the search space. 
In other cases \emph{BO} yields slightly better results (\emph{effect: paper}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 2000$; \emph{effect: paper2}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500$; \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500$).
Across all scenarios, \emph{BO} and \emph{Grid} perform similarly, although due to its evaluation budget, \emph{BO} is allowed only 116 evaluations as opposed to the 1350 evaluations for \emph{Grid}, when using a resolution of 25 points per dimension.
The difference in the number of evaluations is clearly reflected in the average runtime of the optimization methods given in Table~\ref{tab:table_time}.
\emph{BO} is approximately 20 times faster.
\input{generated/tables/table_time.tex}

\label{fig:plot_boxplot_valid_y}
\end{figure}

For \emph{BO Grid}, only solutions on the grid that was evaluated by \emph{Grid} are considered in the evaluation. 
Comparing the results of \emph{BO Grid} to those of \emph{BO} we mainly see similar performances for both.
This indicates that the resolution of \emph{Grid} is fine enough to achieve similar performance to \emph{BO}.

Comparing \emph{BO Grid} to \emph{Grid}, we observe that for the scenarios \emph{effect: paper}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500$ and \emph{effect: paper}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$, \emph{BO Grid} achieves slightly better performance than \emph{Grid}.
This suggests that the \emph{Grid} optimization selects the best outcome "optimistically" from all observed outcomes and does not take into account the stochasticity of the problem, i.e. in this case the noise on the predicted power. 
Accordingly, we assume that for the mentioned scenarios the noise was so high, that \emph{Grid} was misguided by too optimistic outcomes when selecting the final configuration as optimization result.
In our evaluation, the independent validation $y_{\text{valid}}$ represents the unbiased performance of this final configuration, and the overoptimism becomes apparent.
In such scenarios \emph{BO} performs better, since the final configuration is determined based on the mean prediction of the surrogate of \emph{BO}, as explained in Section~\ref{ssec:best_point}.
Further below we will study on a single scenario if a reduced noise due to a higher number of simulations \texttt{nsim} decreases the effect of the overoptimistic selection of \emph{Grid}.

In cases in which \emph{BO} was not able to find a better solution then \emph{Grid}, also \emph{BO Grid} cannot yield better results as it just selects the configuration on the Grid that is closest to the configuration found by \emph{BO}.
Therefore any increase in performance of \emph{BO Grid} compared to \emph{BO} is purely due to chance.

To compare \emph{BO} with a grid search that takes approximately the same time (see Table~\ref{tab:table_time}) and number of evaluations, we consider \emph{Grid Small}.
Here, a resolution of 7 points per dimension leads to 126 evaluations, close to 116 allowed evaluations of \emph{BO}, with only a small advantage for \emph{Grid Small}.
Despite the 10 more evaluations allowed, in the majority of cases \emph{BO} is superior to \emph{Gris Small}, see~Figure~\ref{fig:plot_boxplot_valid_y}.
The advantage is particularly apparent for all scenarios with effect set \emph{effect: linear} and for scenario \emph{effect: paper2}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500$.
Only for the scenarios (\emph{effect: paper2}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$) and (\emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$) \emph{Grid Small} has a small advantage over \emph{BO} and \emph{Grid}.
In the first case, the absolute differences are negligible and all methods lead to a high power.
For the second case, we will later show that the optimal configuration is close to the border of the search space.

As stated above, the high resolution of the exhaustive \emph{Grid} probably leads to the selection of slightly suboptimal configurations close to the optimum due to stochasticity.
These points are not included in the more coarse grid used by \emph{Grid Small}.
In other words, if a configuration close to the optimum is included in the grid used by \emph{Grid Small}, then it is more likely to select it with less overoptimism, as the number of candidates in the region is smaller.

Note that between the scenarios the absolute differences of the optimization results are of different practical relevance. For example, for scenario \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$ \emph{Grid} is superior to \emph{BO}, but the difference is smaller than $0.25\%$.

%After having looked at the best obtained outcome on our problem scenarios and established the ability of \emph{BO} to find equally good configurations as the much more demanding exhaustive \emph{Grid}

\subsection{Detailed analysis of identified configurations}

We now investigate the results in more detail.
We analyze the differences depending on the \emph{selection strategy} and the number of treatments at stage 1, as determined by the \emph{stage ratio} ($r$).
Figure~\ref{fig:plot_allbest} shows the observed outcomes for all evaluations on the grid and the final configurations found by \emph{BO}.
\begin{figure}[htb]

  results are obtained.
  A line connects the mean outcomes for each configuration.

  }
\label{fig:plot_allbest}
\end{figure}
For the selection strategies \emph{epsilon rule} and \emph{threshold rule} only curves representing the $\epsilon$ and $\tau$ values with the best outcome, respectively, are shown.
Note that for the effect sets \emph{linear} and \emph{sigmoid} the curves for selection strategy \emph{1 best} and \emph{eps} are as expected nearly identical.
As intuitively anticipated, in almost all scenarios the worst results were obtained if all available treatments are used in stage 1 and none in stage 2. corresponding to large values on the x-axis.

In all scenarios, \emph{BO} identified the peak of all combined curves.
Within the 20 stochastic repetitions per scenario, \emph{BO} found different configurations, but all had similar high power.
The fact that no unique best setting was found across the repetitions can be attributed to the relatively high noise of the simulation and the relatively flat peaks, i.e.\ different configurations yield similarly good outcomes.
In cases in which multiple optimization runs result in different configurations it might be advisable to let a human expert choose the final configuration, also depending on the medical background.

The curves also show the potential of optimization for the different scenarios.
If the allowed treatment number is high ($n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$), then nearly all design configurations yield high statistical power and optimization is less important.
If the allowed treatment number is too small ($n_{\text{treat}} = 500$), then no configuration yields a practically usable design.
In this situation, a fast optimization helps to determine if a desired treatment number can actually yield sufficiently powerful designs.
Of special interest are the scenarios where the correct choice of the design configuration can make a difference between a design with acceptable power and a design with too low power, e.g. for the scenarios (\emph{effect: linear}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$; \emph{effect: linear}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 2000$, \emph{effect: paper}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$; \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$).
Note, that the selection strategies \emph{thresh} and \emph{all} never selected powerful designs.


%TODO: Write more about the meaning of the results from a clinical point of view?

Figure~\ref{fig:plot_best_x} visualizes in detail which configurations were selected by \emph{BO} and \emph{Grid} and the corresponding values for $y_{\text{valid}}$ (result of the independent validation).
The optimal values for $\epsilon$ and $\theta$ are not shown.
For some scenarios most runs of \emph{Grid} returned the same optimal configurations (e.g.\ for \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$).
In such cases the signal to noise ratio was sufficiently high to reliably find the best configuration.
In some scenarios \emph{Grid} was superior to \emph{BO}, as could be seen in the previously shown Box plots in Figure~\ref{fig:plot_boxplot_valid_y}.
Furthermore, for all scenarios with \emph{effect: sigmoid} and the scenarios \emph{effect: linear}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500)$ and \emph{effect: paper}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500)$, small values of $r$ lead to an optimal outcome.
Here, \emph{BO} was not able to find these values close to the border of the search space.
A common remedy for this problem is to log-transform the values of~$r$.

In other cases \emph{Grid} found different configurations in different runs, while \emph{BO} lead to more stable results, also with higher power values (e.g.\ \emph{effect: linear}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 1000$; \emph{effect: paper2}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500$; \emph{effect: sigmoid}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 500$).
Here we can assume, that \emph{BO} successfully accounted for the noise.
A special case is scenario \emph{effect: paper2}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 2000$:
Here nearly all found configurations yield perfect outcomes.

\subsection{Results for more simulation rounds}

To investigate the effect of the function noise variance ($\sigma^2$) on the optimization result we increase the simulation iterations from $n_\text{sim} = 1000$ to $n_\text{sim} = 5000$, restricting to the scenario \emph{effect: paper}, $n_{\text{treat}} = 2000$.
% This is expected to increase the runtime by a factor of 5. % obvious, also not of interest here
Additionally, we run the algorithms 100 times instead of the previously used 20, in order to obtain more precise estimates for the power values in the independent validation.

We expect that increasing $n_\text{sim}$ decreases the variance of the power values of the identified design configurations.
For the exhaustive \emph{Grid}, we expect that the decreased noise leads to less selections of overly optimistic outcomes.
\emph{BO} should profit as well from a less noisy objective function since the predictions of the surrogate function will be more precise.

Figure~\ref{fig:plot_opt_path_5000} shows that indeed the lower noise level leads to more stable simulation runs, meaning that single optimization runs lead to results closer to the mean result.
It has to be noted that this plot reports the best observed outcome so far and not the one that is chosen as final result.
%So on the left side of Figure~\ref{fig:plot_opt_path_5000}, we see more curves that observed overoptimistic outcomes in comparison the the right side.
%Ideally, the choice of the final point should not be influenced by these overoptimistic observations for \emph{BO} as explained in Section~\ref{ssec:best_point}, as the final point is determined by the surrogates mean prediction.
Despite the differences of the optimization paths, the median validation error reported in Figure~\ref{fig:plot_boxplot_valid_y_5000} is nearly identical for \emph{BO} for the low and the high value of $n_\text{sim}$.
Therefore we can assume that "bias correction" of \emph{BO} as explained in Section~\ref{ssec:best_point} seems to be effective.

  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
For all methods the IQR displayed in the Box plots is much smaller for $n_\text{sim} = 5000$, indicating that the solutions that are found vary less between the 100 stochastic replications.
Also the absolute differences between the methods are even smaller now.
This demonstrates that for the selected scenario all methods can find the optimal configuration if the results are not noisy.
However, an increased value of $n_\text{sim}$ also increases the runtime linearly, which conflicts the goal is to find the optimal configuration quickly.
In summary, \emph{BO} can find configurations with a small number of required simulations (higher noise) that are nearly as good as the optimal solution which is identified with a large number of simulations.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

% subsection Summary
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a state-of-the art optimizer that can be used for parameter optimization in a wide range of applications.
Here, we propose, for the first time, to optimize the power of adaptive designs using BO.
In clinical trials, determining the test methods and sample sizes is a key step in the planning.
One main goal is to maximize the test power, given a set of treatment and effect sizes under the null hypothesis.
If determining the test power involves intensive simulations, trying out different treatment design configurations can become a laborious task.
Either large computational resources are required for an exhaustive investigation of all the different configurations, or a tedious manual try-and-error process is required.

In this paper we applied Bayesian optimization (BO) to quickly find a clinical trial setup with high power from a large number of configuration options.
We compared our approach to an exhaustive grid search by optimizing the power of adaptive seamless designs for different sets of treatment effect sizes.
BO was able to find competitive setups in a fraction of the time and was able to cope well with the stochasticity of the simulation.
% subsection Outlook
Only in cases in which the optimal values of one parameter are close to the lower border, we sometimes observed poor performance of BO.
Here, a possible improvement can be to apply a log transformation to such parameters in the future.
% could be also applied for subgroup selection
% https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8797
Instead of keeping the number of total trials constant, we could apply multi-criteria optimization and include this number as an additional outcome.
This multi-criteria approach would result in a set of points (Pareto front) that minimize the number of trials and at the same time maximize the statistical power of the trail design.
The user could then see for which number of trials the power is above a certain threshold (e.g. $95\%$).

Another way to speed up the optimization would be to iteratively increase the number of simulation rounds of the trial design evaluation. 
If few simulations already indicate a bad outcome for a configuration then additional simulation rounds are not necessary.
Such a procedure can be guided by statistical testing and is already common in machine learning under the terms \emph{racing} or \emph{multi-fidelity optimization}.

% IDEA: Restricting BO to only evaluate configurations on the grid to avoid evaluating identical / very close configurations.
